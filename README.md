# Alpine-geography

Hi,
it's my first python project and I'm trying to outine the alps with countries borders, rivers and lakes.
It's already looking pretty decent but i'd like to get more lakes and rivers into this frame.
Can somebody help me?


All the infos should be found at https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-rivers-lake-centerlines/
but I don't know how to use them
